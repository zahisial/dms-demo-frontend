## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

If cards are not working, check:
1. **Browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Network tab** to ensure mockData is loading
3. **React DevTools** to see if cards are rendering
4. **Click handlers** - ensure no event propagation issues

The implementation is complete and should be fully functional! 🎉
